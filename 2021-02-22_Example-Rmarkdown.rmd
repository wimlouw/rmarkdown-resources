``` {r, setup, include=FALSE}
## You can set individual chunk options (in each chunk), to determine what gets displayed in your rendered document, e.g. figure sizes, whether the chunk is included, warning messages, &c. Or you can set global options that will apply to all code chunks like in this "set-up" chunk. 

## E.g. this is one of my favourite ones, which neatens up your code using the wonderful {styler} package before rendering:

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  tidy = "styler", tidy.opts = list(strict = FALSE)
  
```


**When you start an R Markdown notebook or doc, it will already include some instructions on how to get started, which I'll keep in this example document:**

"This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*."

```{r}

plot(cars)

```

"Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed."
